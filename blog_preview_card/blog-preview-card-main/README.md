This is my solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). The challenge is a great opportunity to practice HTML and CSS by recreating a clean, responsive blog card component.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS3** (custom properties)
- **Flexbox** for layout
- **Mobile-first** responsive design approach
- REM units for scalable spacing and sizing

### What I learned

- How to use `rem` units effectively for scaling components across devices
- Implementing hover states and `cursor: pointer` for better user interaction cues

Here’s a quick example:

```css
h1:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  cursor: pointer;
}
```
