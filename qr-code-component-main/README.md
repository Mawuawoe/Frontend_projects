## Overview
This is a frontend challenge to build a simple, centered QR code card using HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate a design as closely as possible, paying attention to layout, typography, and responsiveness. It helped me practice using rem units, Flexbox for centering, and Google Fonts.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox + Custom Properties)
- Responsive Design using `rem` units
- Desktop-first approach
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I Learned

While building this project, I solidified my understanding of:

- The benefits of using `rem` over `px` for scalable designs
- Applying a consistent layout with Flexbox
- Using media queries to adjust root font size and ensure responsive behavior
- Importing and using custom fonts with different weights via Google Fonts

Example of rem-based sizing:

```css
html {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.card {
  width: 20rem; /* equals 320px */
}
